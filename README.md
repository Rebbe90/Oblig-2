Work on a machine learning algorithm

Do the following:

    Pick one use case
        I chose: Predict stock market price for TESLA. I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the price of this stock on a specific date. Input will be date and output should be price of that          stock (close value in the data file). You should also show the prediction percentage score. 
        Data file: TESLA.csv For updated csv file, please download the data from: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA
        
    Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
        I chose regression
        
    Document your findings in a file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.
        Look at 1st markdown
        
    Train the algorithm using Python
    
    Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
